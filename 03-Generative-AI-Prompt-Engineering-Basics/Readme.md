**Prompt Engineering for Generative AI**

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my coursework, projects, and insights gained during the Prompt Engineering for Generative AI program. The focus of this study is on optimizing interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce accurate, safe, and high-quality outputs.

📚 Curriculum Breakdown
The course is structured into three specialized modules:

**1. Prompt Engineering for Generative AI**
Focus: Core concepts of generative AI.
Key Topics: Understanding model architecture, the role of tokens, and the importance of context in LLM communication.

**2. Prompt Engineering: Techniques and Approaches**
Focus: Advanced strategies and frameworks.
Key Topics: * Zero-Shot & Few-Shot Prompting: Teaching models with limited examples.
Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Guiding models through complex reasoning steps.
Prompt Frameworks: Implementing structured templates (Role, Task, Constraints, Output Format).

**3. Course Quiz, Project, and Wrap-Up**
Focus: Practical application and assessment.
Deliverables: Successful completion of the final assessment and a hands-on prompt engineering project.

**🛠 Skills Acquired**

**Iterative Refinement:** Mastering the loop of testing and adjusting prompts for better performance.

**Hallucination Mitigation:** Crafting constraints to ensure factual accuracy.

**Structured Outputs:** Prompting for specific formats like JSON, Markdown, or Code.

**Persona Adoption:** Assigning specific professional roles to models to tailor the tone and depth of responses.
